# Reinforcement learning for Diabetes


This notebook proposes a reinforcement-learning based algorithm for optimal control of blood glucose in patients with type-1 diabetes. Specifically, the algorithm aims to suggest an optimal insulin injection policy. Its performance was assessed using simulations on a combination of the minimum model and part of the Hovorka model.
